// a function keyword followed by an asterisk is a generator.
// a generator is basically a function that can stop midway and then continue from where it stopped.
// it appears to be a function byt it behaves like an iterator that stops and continues when you call .next()

const people = listPeople() // to use a generator you invoke the generator function and store it in a variable 

console.log(people); // >> listPeopleÂ {<suspended>} .. the output is a suspended generator 


// to iterate or get the value ot let the generator continue or whatever it should be named you call the next method on the variable 
people.next() // >> {value: "bedo", done: false}
people.next() // >> {value: "yara", done: false}
people.next() // >> {value: "noran", done: false}
people.next() // >> {value: "undefined", done: true}

// ofc you can call
people.next().value // to get the value without the object and its details 

//NOTE: if you call listPeople().next()  the generator won't advance to the next iteration, and it will yield the same value over and over


//the prev yielded values were hard coded, but ofc they can be dynamically generated
